cross_phase_architecture:
  design_rules:
    - "Prioritize simplicity and maintainability"
    - "Adhere to technology stack defined in product_description.yaml"
    - "Introduce new dependencies cautiously"
    - "Maximize local development before cloud deployment"

  error_handling:
    - "Phase 1-2 (Local): Fail fast with detailed logging"
    - "Phase 2 (Deployed)+: Consider Sentry or similar for structured error reporting"

  testing_strategy:
    - "Phase 1-2 (Local): Pytest (backend focus)"
    - "Phase 2 (Deployed)+: Add deployment verification"
    - "Phase 3: Add Cypress component tests (frontend interaction - deployed)"
    - "Phase 4: Add E2E tests (key user flows - deployed)"

  security_evolution:
    - "Phase 1 (Local): Standard Django dev security"
    - "Phase 2 (Deployed)+: HTTPS (DO) + Django secure middleware"
    - "Phase 4: CSP headers, review AdSense security implications (deployed)"

  scaling_plan:
    - "Phases 1-4: Focus on optimization first. Vertical scaling via DO App Platform tiers post-deployment."
    - "Post-MVP: Consider read replicas, advanced caching (Redis), horizontal scaling if necessary (on DO)"
