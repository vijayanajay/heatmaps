description: "Vortex IDE Rules - Django + Vanilla JS/Plotly on Heroku/Neon (Phase 1)"
globs: ["*.py", "*.html", "*.js", "Procfile", "*.ini", "*.yaml"]
rules: 
  - dev machine is on windows, so all commands should possible to execute in windows 11 powershell
  - all code should be thought, analyzed and written with the mindset of great developers like Sindre Sorhus, Ryan Dahl, Dan Abramov, Armin Ronacher, Kenneth Reitz
  - read memory.md in the root directory with the errors that occured before and ensure it does not happen again
  - update memory.md with the errors you encountered, the root cause and the fix, so that it does not occur again. If file does not exist in root, create a new file. Ensure that these errors don't occur again

## 📜 Core Philosophy
 
1.  **Simplicity:** Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
2.  **Iterate:** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than building entirely new solutions from scratch, unless fundamentally necessary or explicitly requested.
3.  **Focus:** Concentrate efforts on the specific task assigned. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
4.  **Quality:** Strive for a clean, organized, well-tested, and secure codebase.
5.  **Collaboration:** This document guides both human developers and the AI assistant for effective teamwork.
 
## 📚 Project Context & Understanding
 
1.  **Documentation First:**
    *   **Always** check for and thoroughly review relevant project documentation *before* starting any task. This includes:
        *   Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
        *   `README.md` (Project overview, setup, patterns, technology stack)
        *   `docs/architecture.md` (System architecture, component relationships)
        *   `docs/technical.md` (Technical specifications, established patterns)
        *   `tasks/tasks.md` (Current development tasks, requirements)
    *   If documentation is missing, unclear, or conflicts with the request, **ask for clarification**.
2.  **Architecture Adherence:**
    *   Understand and respect module boundaries, data flow, system interfaces, and component dependencies outlined in `docs/architecture.md`.
    *   Validate that changes comply with the established architecture. Warn and propose compliant solutions if a violation is detected.
3.  **Pattern & Tech Stack Awareness:**
    *   Reference `README.md` and `docs/technical.md` to understand and utilize existing patterns and technologies.
    *   Exhaust options using existing implementations before proposing new patterns or libraries.
 
 
## ⚙️ Task Execution & Workflow
 
1.  **Task Definition:**
    *   Clearly understand the task requirements, acceptance criteria, and any dependencies from `tasks/tasks.md` and the PRD.
2.  **Systematic Change Protocol:** Before making significant changes:
    *   **Identify Impact:** Determine affected components, dependencies, and potential side effects.
    *   **Plan:** Outline the steps. Tackle one logical change or file at a time.
    *   **Verify Testing:** Confirm how the change will be tested. Add tests if necessary *before* implementing (see TDD).
3.  **Progress Tracking:**
    *   Keep `docs/status.md` updated with task progress (in-progress, completed, blocked), issues encountered, and completed items.
    *   Update `tasks/tasks.md` upon task completion or if requirements change during implementation.
 
## 🤖 AI Collaboration & Prompting
 
1.  **Clarity is Key:** Provide clear, specific, and unambiguous instructions to the AI. Define the desired outcome, constraints, and context.
2.  **Context Referencing:** If a task spans multiple interactions, explicitly remind the AI of relevant previous context, decisions, or code snippets.
3.  **Suggest vs. Apply:** Clearly state whether the AI should *suggest* a change for human review or *apply* a change directly (use only when high confidence and task is well-defined). Use prefixes like "Suggestion:" or "Applying fix:".
4.  **Question AI Output:** Human developers should critically review AI-generated code. Question assumptions, verify logic, and don't blindly trust confident-sounding but potentially incorrect suggestions (hallucinations).
5.  **Focus the AI:** Guide the AI to work on specific, focused parts of the task. Avoid overly broad requests that might lead to architectural or logical errors.
6.  **Leverage Strengths:** Use the AI for tasks it excels at (boilerplate generation, refactoring specific patterns, finding syntax errors, generating test cases) but maintain human oversight for complex logic, architecture, and security.
7.  **Incremental Interaction:** Break down complex tasks into smaller steps for the AI. Review and confirm each step before proceeding.
8.  **Standard Check-in (for AI on large tasks):** Before providing significant code suggestions:
    *   "Confirming understanding: I've reviewed [specific document/previous context]. The goal is [task goal], adhering to [key pattern/constraint]. Proceeding with [planned step]."

## ✅ Testing & Validation
 
1.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
    *   **New Features:** Outline tests, write failing tests, implement code, refactor.
    *   **Bug Fixes:** Write a test reproducing the bug *before* fixing it.
2.  **Comprehensive Tests:** Write thorough unit, integration, and/or end-to-end tests covering critical paths, edge cases, and major functionality.
3.  **Tests Must Pass:** All tests **must** pass before committing or considering a task complete. Notify the human developer immediately if tests fail and cannot be easily fixed.
4.  **No Mock Data (Except Tests):** Use mock data *only* within test environments. Development and production should use real or realistic data sources.
5.  **Manual Verification:** Supplement automated tests with manual checks where appropriate, especially for UI changes.
 
## 🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting
 
1.  **Fix the Root Cause:** Prioritize fixing the underlying issue causing an error, rather than just masking or handling it, unless a temporary workaround is explicitly agreed upon.
2.  **Console/Log Analysis:** Always check browser and server console output for errors, warnings, or relevant logs after making changes or when debugging. Report findings.
3.  **Targeted Logging:** For persistent or complex issues, add specific `console.log` statements (or use a project logger) to trace execution and variable states. *Remember to check the output.*
4.  **Check the `fixes/` Directory:** Before deep-diving into a complex or recurring bug, check `fixes/` for documented solutions to similar past issues.
5.  **Document Complex Fixes:** If a bug requires significant effort (multiple iterations, complex logic) to fix, create a concise `.md` file in the `fixes/` directory detailing the problem, investigation steps, and the solution. Name it descriptively (e.g., `fixes/resolve-race-condition-in-user-update.md`).
6.  **Research:** Use available tools (Firecrawl, documentation search, etc.) to research solutions or best practices when stuck or unsure.

### Phase 1: Backend Architecture (Django Core)
component_architecture:
  rules:
    - "Use Django settings split (base.py, dev.py, prod.py)."
    - "Store secrets and environment-specific configs in .env files (using python-dotenv)."
    - "Use dj-database-url for database configuration."
    - "Separate business logic from views into service layers (e.g., `apps/core/services.py`)."
    - "Implement API endpoints using DRF (preferred) or standard Django JsonResponse."
    - "Use management commands for data fetching/processing tasks."

### Phase 1: Frontend Architecture (Vanilla JS + Plotly)
frontend_architecture:
  rules:
    - "Structure JS code logically within `static/js/main.js` or break into modules if complexity increases."
    - "Fetch data asynchronously using the `fetch` API."
    - "Handle loading and error states gracefully in the UI."
    - "Integrate Plotly.js for visualizations, using WebGL where appropriate for performance."
    - "Minimize direct DOM manipulation where possible, update based on data state."
    - "Ensure basic responsiveness using CSS (Flexbox/Grid)."

### Phase 1: Database (PostgreSQL on Neon.tech)
database_rules:
  rules:
    - "Define clear Django models in `apps/core/models.py`."
    - "Use appropriate field types (e.g., `DecimalField` for currency/prices)."
    - "Generate migrations using `makemigrations` and apply using `migrate`."
    - "Optimize database queries using `select_related` and `prefetch_related` where necessary, especially in API views."
    - "Configure connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (handled by dj-database-url)."

### Phase 1: Caching
caching_rules:
  rules:
    - "Implement basic API response caching using Django's cache framework (`django.core.cache`)."
    - "Use `LocMemCache` for local development."
    - "Plan for a proper cache backend (like Redis via Heroku add-on) for later phases."

### Phase 1: Testing
test_organization:
  structure:
    - "apps/core/tests.py" # Initial tests co-located with app
    # - "tests/" # Separate top-level tests dir can be added later
  rules:
    - "Use `pytest` and `pytest-django` for running tests."
    - "Write unit tests for models and services."
    - "Write integration tests for API endpoints using `APITestCase` or `APIClient`."
    - "Aim for reasonable test coverage of core logic."
    - "Mock external services like YFinance during tests."

### Phase 1: CI/CD (GitHub Actions + Heroku)
cicd:
  rules:
    - "Use GitHub Actions for CI."
    - "Configure workflow to run tests (pytest) on push/pull_request."
    - "Configure workflow to automatically deploy to Heroku staging/production based on branch strategy (e.g., main branch -> production)."
    - "Use `heroku-deploy` action for deployment."
    - "Manage Heroku environment variables via Heroku dashboard or CLI, not in Git."
    - "Include a `Procfile` for Heroku web process."

### Phase 1: Monitoring & Logging
monitoring:
  rules:
    - "Implement standard Python/Django logging, outputting to console (Heroku captures stdout/stderr)."
    - "Configure log levels appropriately for dev vs. prod (`settings/dev.py`, `settings/prod.py`)."
    - "Implement a basic `/health/` check endpoint."
    - "Utilize Heroku's built-in metrics and logging via dashboard or CLI (`heroku logs --tail`)."
    # - "Plan for integrating a dedicated monitoring service (e.g., Sentry) in later phases (PDD Phase 4+)."

### Phase 1: Security
security_evolution:
  - "Use HTTPS (handled by Heroku)."
  - "Configure Django's built-in security middleware (`settings/prod.py`: `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, etc.)."
  - "Keep `SECRET_KEY` secure using environment variables."
  - "Set `DEBUG=False` in production."
  - "Use environment variables for all sensitive credentials (DB URL, API keys)."

### Phase 1: Documentation Links
references:
  - "Django Documentation (4.2)"
  - "Plotly.js Documentation"
  - "Heroku Dev Center"
  - "Neon.tech Documentation"
  - "Python `dotenv` Documentation"
  - "dj-database-url Documentation"
